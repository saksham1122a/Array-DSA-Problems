Exploring the DSA World, Starting solving some DSA problems from very scratch:
I'll be working on Array problems, main aim is to grab the basic understanding of the logic, implement it and continuing the progress in real timr
Problems: -
Problem-1 :- Two Sum
It's a popular array-based question frequently asked by top tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Adobe.

🔍 Concepts Used:

Hash map (std::map<int, int>) for constant-time lookups

Iteration with for loop to calculate remaining values

Time complexity: O(n) – optimized over brute-force approaches

Problem-2 :- Kth Largest Element

Learned how min-heap can optimize problems efficiently instead of brute force approaches. 

Problem-3  :- Reverse an array

Implemented an efficient two-pointer approach to reverse the entire way in-place, ensuring optimal time and space complexity.

Problem-4  :- Reverse an array from a specific index

Extended the logic to reverse elements starting from a given position, which required careful index handling and reinforced my understanding of array boundaries and pointer movements.
